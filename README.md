# Pitchfork-Review-Scrapper
A python script that scrapes album reviews and associated metadata from Pitchfork, an online music website.

## Requirements
1. Python
2. Selenium (pip install selenium)

## How-to
1. Run the url_scrape.py script (change the page # variable to the appropriate number)
2. Run the album.py script (if you are generating all 19,000 reviews, expect this script to take a minute)
3. ????
4. Profit

## To-dos
- [ ] Change the outputs so if there is nothing for a specific field (say, a missing abstract), it outputs a blank space to perserve the integrity of the CSV formatting.
- [ ] Change the outputs so that there aren't weird new line spaces in the txt ouput file (really makes the CSV weird)
